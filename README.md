# dotfiles-prov

This repository contains dotfiles and an Ansible playbook which are used to
automatically provision my personal work environment.

Dotfiles are files stored in the home directory which are used to configure
programs. Once these programs are configured, it feels very much like home. And
there's no place like `~/`!

**The playbook will eventually work on linux.**
